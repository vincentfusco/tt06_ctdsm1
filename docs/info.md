## How it works

A 3rd-order CTDSM.

## How to test

Input a 1Vpp sinewave on a 1V bias. (Max input up to 1.5, min input down to 0.3). Use an oscilloscope to measure the bitstream.
Generate the spectrum for the bitstream and calculate the ENOB by assuming brickwall filter at 20kHz.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
